    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Our team commenced its work for the first time in one of the electrical engineering department classes of Shahid Beheshti University in the summer of 2020. Amidst the COVID-19 conditions and simultaneous evacuation of students from the university, the team members were the ones who, with masks on their faces, pursued progress, endeavor, and robotics in the vacant university environment.
        Throughout the past years, this team has persistently continued its scientific activities with dedication and motivation, appearing stronger each day than the previous. Every title and honor this team has achieved is a testament to the relentless efforts of its hardworking members.
        A team that started with 6 members now has over 30 active or graduated members. In addition to scientific goals, social goals and knowledge dissemination have always been important characteristics of this team. To date, more than 20 training courses in the fields related to robotics, programming, and technology have been held by this team, and its members have always considered one of their missions to advance the scientific level of the surrounding community.
        In addition to their scientific colleagues, the members of this team foster an unparalleled team spirit among themselves, and teamwork and collaboration are fundamental attributes of this team, whose members are, above all, friends to one another.
        Dr. Mohammad Hossein Moayeri, the robotics team advisor and associate professor of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, has been alongside this team from the very beginning, contributing to the team's sustainability and strength.
